      <h3>City or Nature?</h3>
    <p>The beach is the place to go whenever someone feels down, wants to relax, or just to go to have fun. Usually it is always peaceful and quiet.
        Life in a city is a really busy life. People who live in big cities, they are always busy. Some of them are busy with their business and some of them are busy with their job. In the morning, in a big city, you will find people doing morning walk or exercise.
